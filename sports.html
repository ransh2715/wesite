        <h2>Badminton</h2>
        <p>
            Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. It can be played
            by two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The game has its origins in ancient
            civilizations, but the modern version of badminton has its roots in British India. It became popular
            internationally in the mid-20th century. Badminton is known for its fast-paced rallies and requires
            agility, speed, and precision.

            The shuttlecock, also known as a birdie, is made from feathers or synthetic materials. Badminton is
            played indoors to prevent the wind from affecting the shuttlecock's flight. It is an Olympic sport and
            is widely enjoyed as a recreational activity as well.
